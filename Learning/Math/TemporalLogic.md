# Temporal Logic

Briefly, _Temporal Logic_ is any system which expresses propositions vis a vis a

## Formal Description 

| Relation      | Interpretation         |
|---------------|------------------------|
| X < Y, Y > X  | X takes place before Y |
| X m Y, Y mi X | X meets Y              |
| X o Y, Y oi X | X overalps with Y      |
| X s Y, Y si X | X starts Y             |
| X d Y, Y di X | X during Y             |
| X f Y, Y fi X | X finishes Y           |
| X = Y         | X is Equal to Y        |
