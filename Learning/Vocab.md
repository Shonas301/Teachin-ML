# Words You Need To Know

  * Feature:
    A Feature is literally any piece of relevant information that we have on a
    data point. This can be discrete (an integer or floating point value) or
    categorical (Red vs. Blue / True vs. False). We usually choose to encode all
    categorical values if we care about them.
